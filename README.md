# Fluxus Key System Bypass

This script allows you to bypass Fluxus Windows Key System and retrieve the key without going through the Linkvertise monetization process.
**We have more bypasses for other executors such as: Electron, Fluxus Android, Oxygen U and Scriptware IOS**

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Requests library
- Operating System: Windows/Linux/Macos (As long as it can run Python 3.x)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the script.

2. Install the required libraries using pip:
   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the script using the command

   WINDOWS
    ```shell
    python main.py
    ```
    
4. Get your get key link from the Key U.I in Fluxus, by pressing the get key button and then copy it from the browser. It should look something like this: https://flux.li/windows/start.php?HWID=948h4f5b734f11edbfab826e6f6e83635ed0b5f31b21804e51e82664dc24eabc (This one is a fake one ofcourse)
5. Paste it in the program and wait, the key should appear instantly!
